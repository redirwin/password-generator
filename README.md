# Random Password Generator

This small project is a [Skrimba](https://scrimba.com/) challenge to create a random password generator from scratch using a provided [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/YRO9Iw5IYaOorjnRyNz4bV/Random-Password-Generator?node-id=0%3A1) as reference. The final MVP generates a list of four random passwords (a combination of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters) when the user clicks the _Generate Passwords_ button.

My solution uses four JS functions to complete the challenge and is [hosted here](https://redirwin.github.io/password-generator/).

## MVP requirements:

- Array to hold all possible chars
- Button to generate 4 random password options
- Display password options

## This project utilizes the following technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

## Thoughts on possible upgrades:

- Add a color-coded password strength bar
- Add _click to copy_ on each password field
- Add user input options such as password length and types of characters allowed
- Refactor JavaScript: could use a forEach() on the element array, etc.
