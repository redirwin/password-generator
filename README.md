# Random Password Generator

The purpose of this challenge was to create a random password generator from scratch using a provided Figma design as reference. The final MVP generates a list of four random passwords (a combination of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters) when the user clicks the **Generate Passwords** button.

The original Figma design can be [found here](https://www.figma.com/file/YRO9Iw5IYaOorjnRyNz4bV/Random-Password-Generator?node-id=0%3A1).

My code uses four seperate functions to complete the challenge.
